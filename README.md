## Play online at the link above!

You can also run a local copy by cloning this repository to your machine and using the following combined command:

```
npm i && npm run compile && npm start
```

This will install the required dependencies, transpile the TypeScript into JavaScript and then create a server (by default, on port 5000). You can then go to http://localhost:5000 to play the game.

Enjoy!
